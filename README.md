## “Absorbance_Peaks_Overlapping.csv”

Region of 7,200 cm-1 is where our analyzer, L2130-i-C CRDS model, analyzes at. Region 7,184 cm-1 is where Brand et al (2009) analyzes at using a  L1102-i CRDS model. This set of data will show baseline shifts caused by EtOH and MeOH on H2O and HDO IR absorbance peaks. Moreover, because L2130-i-C and L1102-i models analyze at slightly different wavenumber regions, it explains why Brand’s regression of EtOH affecting isotopic values is slightly different from our experiments’ regression.

## “EtOH_Effect_on_d18O_dD.csv”

Good data with spot-on Quality Control check. Has [EtOH] from 0 - 5%, and shows d18O and dD effects with varying treatments: (1) Untreated, (2) MCM-on, (3) Activated Charcoal, (4) Solid Phase Extraction. 
NOTE: SPE-treated samples still need to be checked for exact [EtOH] % that was initially used before treatment (this is to make sure each EtOH sample before treatment is understood exactly and its concentration not just assumed as a set number). Nonetheless, this data set for SPE is part of a good set of runs, and upon my arrival back on campus (Sept 12th), I’ll do a quick NMR analysis.
